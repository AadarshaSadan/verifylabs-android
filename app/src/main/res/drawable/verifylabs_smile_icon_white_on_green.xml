  <!-- White Smile Icon (Scaled down slightly to fit inside 24x24 or reusing the path logic) -->
  <!-- The original path was for 24x24 full size. If I just paste it, it covers the circle.
       The original transparency icon had the ring and face.
       Let's use a simpler approach: Just the face features if possible, or overlay the ring.
       Original Path: M11.99,2C6.47,2 2,6.48 2,12... (Outline).
       I will use the original path but fill it WHITE. Since it's an outline circle + face, it will look like White Ring + Face on top of Green Circle (if the circle is bigger?).
       Actually, if I fill the original path with White, it will be a White Circle with holes for eyes/mouth? No, the path describes the strokes.
       Let's look at old path again: M12,20c-4.42,0... is the inner cutout.
       So it's a Ring.
       If I want "White on Green", I probably want a Filled White Circle with Green Face? OR Green Circle with White Face.
       The screenshot shows: Green Circle, White Face inside.
       So I need a White Face path.
       I will assume the ring path M11.99... is the container.
       Let's try drawing the Green Circle, then drawing the White Path on top.
       Since the White Path defines the Ring and Features, it will result in a White Ring+Face on Green. This matches the "White on Green" description.
